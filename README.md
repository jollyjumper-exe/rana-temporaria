### About Shader Journey

Hi there! 👋  
I'm currently diving into the world of shader programming—something I've recently started exploring and truly enjoy learning. Whenever inspiration strikes (and time allows), I experiment with shaders and share my results here.

🎨 You can preview them [right here](https://jollyjumper-exe.github.io/rana-temporaria/).

If you have questions, feedback, or just want to chat about shaders, feel free to reach out. I might even reply. 😉
